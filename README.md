# Vietnamese Financial Data
Data collected from balance sheet and income statement of over  1000 enterprises operating in Vietnam in 2021.

# Context
This data was collected as a part of my personal project. I decided to aggregate and publish it for everyone.

Modern economy makes decision based on data. I hope this data will help you (somewhat) understand the Vietnamese market and make reasonable decision.

# Data description
Data was collected from published balance sheet and income statement of companies. Due to the fact that some areas in the economy required dissimilar report template (banks for example), there are sections only availble for companies in those areas. To keep it easy, I put everything into a single file and just simply leave missing values -1. Section names is remained the same as what is in the original report.

Data is saved in both csv and xlsx formats so that you can analyze using Excel or further exploit it with programming tools like R, Python, or Julia.
